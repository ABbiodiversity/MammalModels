As of 2023-12-20, the ABMI has deployed X number of cameras across the province. 2.2 Camera deployment protocols The ABMI’s remote camera deployment protocols can be accessed here: Terrestrial ABMI Autonomous Recording Unit (ARU) and Remote Camera Trap Protocols. 2.3 List of ABMI camera projects The following camera projects have been deployed by the ABMI: Organize by year? Use gt package? Note - would be nice to have a link to the WildTrax project for those projects that are published.

Raw data is also publicly available from the ABMI via this platform. The image tagging protocols used by the ABMI can be accessed here: There is a companion R package, wildRtrax, which is also publicly available and contains many useful functions for downloading and analyzing camera data hosted on the platform. Throughout this document, references will be made to functions within this package. Note: Would be nice to insert the wildRtrax package logo. 2.4 Species detections (2014-2021) The map below displays mammal species detections at ABMI Ecosystem Health (core grid) sites sampled with cameras between 2014 and 2023. Each site is sampled with 4 individual cameras placed 600-m apart in a square shape. (Note: Need to add EH 2023) Sampling Year: 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Species: 2.5 Deployment duration lengths Here we can include all those figures. Yay. Do we really want that?
